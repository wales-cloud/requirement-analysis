# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project

The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, this project will simulate a real-world scenario in building a booking management system, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining project needs.

## Learning Objective

This project is designed to enhance a professional developerâ€™s ability to:

* Master principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
* Translate business/project needs into structured documentation.
* Identify and document both functional and non-functional requirements.
* Use tools like Draw\.io to create visual diagrams representing system requirements.
* Define clear acceptance criteria aligned with business and user goals.
* Apply best practices to produce industry-standard technical documentation.

## Requirements to Complete the Project

To participate and complete the project successfully, learners should:

* Have a GitHub account and know how to create and manage repositories.
* Be familiar with writing clear markdown documentation (README.md).
* Understand the SDLC and the role of requirement analysis.
* Know how to use visual diagram tools (e.g., Draw\.io).
* Be able to define and communicate use cases, requirements, and criteria.

## Key Highlights

* **Real-World Simulation**: Replicates professional requirement analysis workflows.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Functional vs. non-functional requirements, use cases, and user stories.
* **Visual Tools**: Use diagrams to enhance understanding of actor-system interactions.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success metrics for each requirement.
* **Professional Standards**: Structure and practices aligned with industry norms.

This repository serves as the structured workspace to complete all tasks related to requirement analysis, setting the groundwork for a robust and scalable software system.
