# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project

The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, this project will simulate a real-world scenario in building a booking management system, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining project needs.

## Learning Objective

This project is designed to enhance a professional developerâ€™s ability to:

* Master principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
* Translate business/project needs into structured documentation.
* Identify and document both functional and non-functional requirements.
* Use tools like Draw\.io to create visual diagrams representing system requirements.
* Define clear acceptance criteria aligned with business and user goals.
* Apply best practices to produce industry-standard technical documentation.

## Requirements to Complete the Project

To participate and complete the project successfully, learners should:

* Have a GitHub account and know how to create and manage repositories.
* Be familiar with writing clear markdown documentation (README.md).
* Understand the SDLC and the role of requirement analysis.
* Know how to use visual diagram tools (e.g., Draw\.io).
* Be able to define and communicate use cases, requirements, and criteria.

## Key Highlights

* **Real-World Simulation**: Replicates professional requirement analysis workflows.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Functional vs. non-functional requirements, use cases, and user stories.
* **Visual Tools**: Use diagrams to enhance understanding of actor-system interactions.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success metrics for each requirement.
* **Professional Standards**: Structure and practices aligned with industry norms.

This repository serves as the structured workspace to complete all tasks related to requirement analysis, setting the groundwork for a robust and scalable software system.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.

This process ensures that the development team fully understands what needs to be built and that the final product aligns with the goals of both the business and the end users. Requirement Analysis lays the groundwork for effective planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

### Key Activities

* **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting input from stakeholders using methods such as interviews, surveys, and workshops.
* **Requirement Documentation**: Defining and recording clear, concise, and comprehensive requirements.
* **Requirement Validation**: Reviewing requirements to ensure they are correct, complete, and feasible.
* **Requirement Prioritization**: Ranking features and functionalities based on stakeholder needs and project scope.

### Importance in the SDLC

* Helps avoid misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers.
* Reduces the risk of costly changes and project delays.
* Provides a clear reference for design, development, and quality assurance.
* Ensures that the product delivers real value to users and aligns with business objectives.
* Forms the basis for test planning, acceptance criteria, and performance evaluation.
